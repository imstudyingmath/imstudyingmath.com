title: On the Characteristic of a Ring
---

I was reading the section on the characteristic of a field in my textbook.

## In the Textbook

The definition goes something like this:

> Let  be the natural homomorphism from  to a field .
> * If $Ker(\phi) = (0)$, the characteristic is $0$.
> * If $p$ is a prime number and $Ker(\phi) = p\Z$, the characteristic is $p$.
> 
> 

## In `mathlib`

I tried looking for it in `mathlib` (with some help from an LLM), and found this:

```lean
class _root_.CharP (R : Type*) [AddMonoidWithOne R] (p : outParam ℕ) : Prop where
  cast_eq_zero_iff (R p) : ∀ x : ℕ, (x : R) = 0 ↔ p ∣ x

```

It seems this is how it's defined.

But... this looks quite different from the textbook definition.

Neither $Ker$ nor $p\Z$ makes an appearance here.
Maybe this is just a "classic `mathlib` moment."

## Defining Characteristic Following the Textbook

Just to see, I tried defining it myself while following the textbook as closely as possible (again, with some help from an LLM):

```lean
import Mathlib.RingTheory.Ideal.Maps

class CharP (K : Type) [Ring K] (p : ℕ) : Prop where
  kernel_eq_span : RingHom.ker (Int.castRingHom K) = Ideal.span { (p : ℤ) }

```

And... it compiled without errors!

Though, I still feel like I might not fully grasp everything yet...

### Notes on the Textbook-Style Definition

It seems `RingHom.ker (Int.castRingHom K)` corresponds to .

As for the `Ideal.span` part:

* `Ideal.span {(p : ℤ)}` is the set of all multiples of  (i.e., ).
* `Ideal.span {(0 : ℤ)}` is the ideal generated by , which is .

It turns out you don't actually need to write a separate case for "If it is ...". The single expression covers both!

That’s all for today!
